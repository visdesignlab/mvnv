# VDL Profiles

All VDL members are responsible for updating their content regularly.



## Creating a VDL Member Profile

Please create a profile using the template here. Save this as a new Markdown
file with your name as a unique key. In the template, do not remove or delete
any rows! If you don't have the information right now, just leave the data empty
or as-is. Please try to fill in something for every row, if possible. Active
members should select their role, write down some interests, have a webpage, and
include a photo.

## Adding a VDL Member Picture

All active members of VDL should add a headshot. Please following the
[instructions for adding images here](../assets/images/README.md).



## Creating a Collaborator Profile

Use "`role: collaborator`" for collaborators on publications. Please note that
this is not strictly necessary. You can just type the person's full name in the
author list, but it might be useful if you're collaborating with a person a lot.
