abstract: "Reflection is a core method used by visualization researchers to generate knowledge from design practice. There is, however, a lack of standards to inform reflective practice and through which we can judge the quality of the reflection used in visualization research. Reflecting on this gap, we offer priorities for researchers looking to improve the use of reflection in applied visualization research."
