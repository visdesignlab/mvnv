abstract: "<p>
Air quality is important, varies across time and space, and is largely invisible. Pioneering past work deploying air quality
monitors in residential environments found that study participants improved their awareness of and engagement with air
quality. However, these systems fielded a single monitor and did not support user-specified annotations, inhibiting their
utility. We developed MAAV– a system to <b>M</b>easure <b>A</b>ir quality, <b>A</b>nnotate data streams, and <b>V</b>isualize real-time PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels –
to explore how participants engage with an air quality system addressing these challenges. MAAV supports collecting data
from multiple air quality monitors, annotating that data through multiple modalities, and sending text message prompts
when it detects a PM<sub>2.5</sub> spike. MAAV also features an interactive tablet interface for displaying measurement data and
annotations. Through six long-term field deployments (20-47 weeks, mean 37.7 weeks), participants found these system
features important for understanding the air quality in and around their homes. Participants gained new insights from
between-monitor comparisons, reflected on past PM<sub>2.5</sub> spikes with the help of their annotations, and adapted their system
usage as they familiarized themselves with their air quality data and MAAV. These results yield important insights for
designing residential sensing systems that integrate into users’ everyday lives.
