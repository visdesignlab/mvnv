I'm working with Miriah and Pascal on air quality in salt lake city. So far, we've built some interesting visualization tools that look at both model estimates and real time measured data. I'm currently looking at how we can see discrepancies between the two, plus how different interactions for event viewing. Besides vis, I love a good jaunt in the woods and new experiences to expand my palate."
