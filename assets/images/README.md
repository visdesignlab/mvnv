# Adding Images

When you add images to the site, please be considerate of their file size. See
compression recommendations below. All publication videos and PDF's should go
on the SCI webserver, **NOT** on GitHub.



## Image Compression

We recommend using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) for your images, since it
produces small, quality images for both JPG and PNG. If you have Adobe
Photoshop, there is a function to
[export to web](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/creativesuite/cs/using/WS6E857477-27FE-4a88-B8A4-074DC3C65F68.html).
Other useful compression sites are [Optimizilla](http://optimizilla.com/) and
[jpeg.io](https://www.jpeg.io/).




## Publication Images

For every publication, you should provide two images: a thumbnail and a teaser.
The thumbnail is **MANDATORY**. If you do not provide a teaser image, your
publication will not show up on the front page, but that may be ideal for some
situations.


The image should be named `YYYY_CONFSHORTNAME_PAPERSHORTNAME.png` for the
thumbnail and `YYYY_CONFSHORTNAME_PAPERSHORTNAME_teaser.png` for the larger
teaser figure. Both should be stored in the `images/publications/` directory.


The aspect ratio for both should be 2:1. The teaser should be roughly 1200x600
and be in the neighborhood of 200-300 kb. The thumbnail should be roughly
400x200 with a file size of roughly 50-70 kb.



## People Images

Please upload a grayscale headshot of yourself into the `images/people/`
directory. Your picture should be:

- aspect ratio: square or 1:1
- resolution: up to 400x400 px
- format: JPG
- size: ~20 kb
