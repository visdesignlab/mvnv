 My research is on visual data analysis methods for the biomedical domain. Data and analytical methods have become ubiquitous, yet human reasoning and contextual knowledge are critical to discovery and decision making. **My team and I develop innovative, interactive, visual data analysis methods that leverage both, the power of computation and the unique abilities of humans to interpret large and complex datasets.**

My work is often inspired by domain problems: I collaborate with scientists in biomedicine to develop novel methods and tools to tackle their complex data analysis problems. This approach grounds my work in real needs and lets me conduct detailed task and requirement analysis.

## Bio

I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](http://www.sci.utah.edu/) and the [School of Computing](http://cs.utah.edu) at the University of Utah. Together with Miriah Meyer, I run the Visualization Design Lab where we develop visualization methods and systems to help solve today's scientific problems.

Before joining the University of Utah, I was a lecturer and post-doctoral visualization researcher at Harvard University. I received my PhD, master's, and undergraduate degrees from the Graz University of Technology. In 2011 I was a visiting researcher at Harvard Medical School.

I am the recipient of an NSF CAREER award and multiple best paper awards or honorable mentions at IEEE VIS, ACM CHI, and other conferences. I also received a best dissertation award from my alma mater. I co-founded the [Caleydo Project](http://www.caleydo.org/), an open source visualization framework for biomolecular data, and have co-founded [Datavisyn](http://www.datavisyn.io/), a startup company developing visual analytics solutions for the pharmaceutical industry.
